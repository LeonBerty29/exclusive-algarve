This eliminates unpleasant surprises and wasting time on visiting properties that will cause you frustration.",

The promissory contract is the official binding contract outlining the accepted terms of the sale - the price, conditions of payment, dates of completion, and any other conditions both parties might have agreed upon. With the signing of this contract, the initial payment on the property is then required. Generally it will take about 2 weeks for lawyers to get the contract signed and to secure the deal. Once signed, you have officially accepted to purchase the property and you will soon have your dream home.",
    "purchaseStepsOutline": "PURCHASE STEPS OUTLINE",
    "powerOfAttorneyDescription": "Power of attorney - If you are not in Portugal, and might not be present for the signing of the deeds, it is recommended that you issue a POA (Power of Attorney). This will allow your legal representative to obtain your fiscal number, sign the promissory contract, and deeds on your behalf. (The POA will also be useful for after you acquire the property, in order to change all the utility bills into your name on your behalf.)",
    "lawyerAndCpcvDescription": "Lawyer requests a fiscal number for the buyer(s). CPCV, preparation of the promissory contract. Generally, a minimum of 10% deposit is required on the CPCV, unless agreed otherwise. With off-plan properties or ones that are under construction, a plan of stage payments might be put in place.",

    "buyAndOwnParagraph2": "Deeds can be done as quickly as 2 weeks or as slow as weeks or months. There is no rule that determines the timeline of this process. The timing is determined by the needs of the buyer and seller, and the workload and speed of the legal representatives involved. Generally the deeds are scheduled between 2-6 weeks after the promissory contract has been signed. We always recommend to the buyer to inspect the property prior to the deeds to confirm that the property is being signed over in a clean and good condition to be moved into, as well as if there is inventory included in the sale, that it is confirmed and in acceptable condition.",
    "buyAndOwnParagraph3": "Deeds are done at a public notary office. Either party can select the notary. There is no restriction on the council or area where it must be done. At this stage, the buyer must provide the payment for the remainder of the purchase price. Commonly done by a certified cheque, or bank cheque. (Must be ordered in advance). Once the deeds have been signed, the new owner of the property receives the keys and all respective accesses to the property.",
    "buyAndOwnParagraph4": "**** due to the new regulations implemented for the prevention of Money Laundering, all notaries and Real estate Agencies must obtain personal documentation on the parties involved and all real estate transactions are then reported to the Real estate and Construction institute (IMPIC) The notary will then officially register the property to your name at the Land Registry office and tax department.
